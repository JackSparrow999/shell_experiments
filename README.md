# shell_experiments

This is just my first try on shell. A simple repository made for reference to shell script constructs.

Clone this and cd to the directory.

Then use the following command to give execute permissions to the current user: sudo chmod +x intro.sh
Enter password if prompted

Finally run this using the following on the terminal command line: ./intro.sh
